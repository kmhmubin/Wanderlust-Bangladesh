Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s at the center of national government, trade and culture. The 17th-century old city was the Mughal capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain. American architect Louis Khan’s National Parliament House complex typifies the huge, fast-growing modern metropolis.</p><p>In Dhaka’s old city, grand, 17th-century Lalbagh Fort contains a museum of paintings, weapons and decorative arts. The Dhakeshwari Temple is the focus of the city’s Hindu community. The National Museum traces Bangladesh’s natural, religious and political history. Graphic displays at the Liberation War Museum reveal the horrors of the 1971 War of Independence. The elaborate 19th-century Ahsan Manzil, or Pink Palace, stands beside the river. Wooden boats offer trips on the water from the busy Sadarghat boat terminal, the heart of traditional riverside life. Colorful painted rickshaws are the city’s main mode of transport.</p><h2><strong>You\'re Going to Love Dhaka</strong></h2><p>A heady blend of ancient and modern on almost every corner, friendly locals, and a wealth of historical monuments - there are lots of great reasons to plan your trip to Dhaka.<strong>Top 5 Reasons to Visit Dhaka</strong></p><h3><strong>1. You\'ll Never Feel Lonely</strong></h3><p>Dhaka\'s streets are filled with thousands of locals every day. It\'s one of the most populous cities in the world and locals extend a warm welcome to overseas visitors.</p><h3><strong>2. Dhakeshwari Temple</strong></h3><p>An essential stop on any visit to Dhaka, the 1,200-year-old temple is the center of Hindu religion in the region and known for its beautiful architecture.</p><h3><strong>3. Sadarghat Riverfront</strong></h3><p>Sadarghat is one of the largest river ports in the world and it\'s a constant stream of activity. Marvel at day-to-day life on the banks of the Buriganga River, or take one of the small boats to the center of the river to enjoy a few moments of peace and calm.</p><h3><strong>4. Ahsan Manzil</strong></h3><p>The spectacular \'pink palace\' was the summer home of Sheikh Enayet Ullah during the Mughal period and a French trading house in the 18th century.</p><h3><strong>5. It\'s a Great Base for Explorers</strong></h3><p>Enjoy trips to the UNESCO-listed Sundarbans National Park, the world\'s largest mangrove forest. Alternatively, take a paddle steamer to Bagerhat, a Muslim city dating from the 15th century.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What to do in Dhaka</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Dhakeshwari-Tempel: A Haven of Hindu Peace</strong></h3><p>Located just south of the city center, Dhakeshwari Temple is officially designated as Bangladesh\'s national Hindu center. Initially built way back in the 12th century, most of the current complex dates back to the era of the British East India Company. When you take a tour, you can get acquainted with Lord Shiva, who presides over the site, and take in one of the city\'s most serene spaces. It\'s a place that has endured for centuries as a Hindu island in a mainly Muslim country, and one that continues to thrive today.</p><h3><strong>2. Lalbagh Fort Masjid: Abandoned, Restored, and Unmissable</strong></h3><p>Dhaka\'s most spectacular building isn\'t a religious structure. Instead, it\'s Lalbagh Masjid - a fort that was partially erected by the area\'s Mughal rulers in the late 17th century before being deemed unlucky and abandoned for centuries. Nowadays, the defensive motive has gone, and the fort is an oasis of beautifully tended gardens and restored architecture. If you can get to the site near daybreak or sunset, the rose red stone used to build the fort glimmers beautifully in the light. And don\'t miss the Diwan, with its impressive collection of Mughal paintings.</p><h3><strong>3. Khan Mohammead Mridha Mosque: A Divine Dhaka Attraction</strong></h3><p>Double up when visiting Lalbagh Fort by adding this gorgeous mosque to your day of sight-seeing. Just 500 meters away from the fort, Khan Mohammad Mridha is also a 17th century creation. Characterized by broad stairways and domed platforms, the mosque is clad with sculptures and decorative details, and it\'s a delight to explore. It\'s also not a working mosque anymore, but it is protected by the Bangladeshi State, keeping this Islamic jewel in pristine condition.</p><h3><strong>4. Star Mosque: Dhaka\'s Stellar Attraction</strong></h3><p>Located a few kilometers southeast of the downtown area in Armanitola, the Star Mosque is definitely worth an excursion. This time around, the architecture dates from the 19th century, when bright white china tiles were all the rage. The mosque is famous for its star-shaped courtyard pool, as well as its stunning \'chinitikri\' mosaics, which spread the star motif across the whole site. Very different from Khan Mohammad Mridha, the Star Mosque presents another, more ornate side of Dhaka, and it\'s definitely a visual treat.</p><h3><strong>5. Ahsan Manzil: Dhaka\'s Pink Palace</strong></h3><p>Dhaka in the 19th century was both a royal capital and a center of the British Raj, so it\'s not that surprising to find a wealth of attractions from that period. Ahsan Manzil is among the most beautiful of these, and it\'s a true must-see. Built in the 1860s by the local Nawab, or prince, the palace is 125 meters long and made from vivid pink stone, creating an unforgettable vista as you approach. There are more sensory delights inside, including grandiose royal paintings and even the skull of the building\'s creator Abdul Ghani\'s favorite elephant.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://content.r9cdn.net/rimg/dimg/2b/a4/e8e7f581-lm-207-1600ddfb227.jpg?crop=true&amp;width=688&amp;height=350\" alt=\"Lalbagh Fort Masjid\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Get to Dhaka</strong></h2><h3><strong>Plane</strong></h3><p>There are flights to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (DAC) from most continents. The airport is 13 miles from central Dhaka and travelers can reach the city easily by train from Airport Railway Station directly opposite the terminal, and you can also take a tuk-tuk into town for around tk400.</p><h3><strong>Train</strong></h3><p>The Maitree Express from Kolkata is the country\'s only international rail service. The journey to Dhaka takes just under 11 hours.</p><h3><strong>Car</strong></h3><p>The most commonly used route from India is via the Haridaspur/Benapole border crossing on the Kolkata to Dhaka highway. Travelers should be aware that visa and passport checks can take a considerable time.</p><h3><strong>Bus</strong></h3><p>Buses from Kolkata to Dhaka arrive at Gabtoli Bus Station. Take a taxi or auto-rickshaw from the station to the center of the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Where to Stay in Dhaka</strong></h2><p>Dhaka is a thriving business destination so you\'ll find lots of luxury hotels like the Radisson Blu Dhaka Water Garden and the Westin Dhaka. Mid-range hotels include Rigs Inn.</p><h3><strong>Popular Neighborhoods in Dhaka</strong></h3><p><strong>Old Dhaka</strong> - the 17th-century old town is where you\'ll find Tara Masjid (Star Mosque), Lalbagh Fort, and the Ahsan Manzil.</p><p><strong>Motijheel</strong> - this is the city\'s financial and commercial hub. Attractions include Pir Jongi Mazar and the Ramakrishna Mission.</p><p><strong>Gulshan</strong> - an upscale residential neighborhood to the south of the city center, Gulshan boasts some of Dhaka\'s best restaurants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Get Around Dhaka</strong></h2><h3><strong>Public Transportation</strong></h3><p>Buses can be very crowded and, as signs are in Bengali, of little use to tourists. Cycle rickshaws are cheap and efficient, and a 15-minute ride costs tk30-50. Auto-rickshaws are the most useful option, and a trip to Gulshan from Old Dhaka costs tk150-250.</p><h3><strong>Taxi</strong></h3><p>Metered taxis are difficult to hail on the street so it\'s best to book from your hotel. You\'ll be marked as a foreign tourist in the back of a taxi so auto-rickshaw is often a better choice if you don\'t want to attract beggars and street vendors.</p><h3><strong>Car</strong></h3><p>Driving in Dhaka can be difficult for visitors as locals and traffic police tend to ignore the basic rules of the road. It\'s best to rent a car with a local driver. Prices start at tk2500 per day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Cost of Living in Dhaka</strong></h2><h3><strong>Shopping Streets</strong></h3><p>Visit the Banga Bazar on Gulistan Road for incredibly cheap clothing and accessories. Shop at the Bashundhara City mall for well-known brands, or look for jewelry made with local pink pearls in Gulshan.</p><h3><strong>Groceries and Other</strong></h3><p>Stock up on food and other essentials at local supermarkets like Agora Super Shop. Expect to pay tk105 for a dozen eggs.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://content.r9cdn.net/rimg/images/costoflivingitems/meal/meal1.png?v=22c4cba6210139cd15cd81fd3c5d40f8ab3e9c93&amp;cluster=4&amp;width=325&amp;height=175\" alt=\"Cheap meal\"></figure><p>Cheap meal</p><p><strong>$2.53</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://content.r9cdn.net/rimg/images/costoflivingitems/shopping/shopping1.jpg?v=0699128030ade5023a0376d6adcd5b53d42ec362&amp;cluster=4&amp;width=325&amp;height=175\" alt=\"A pair of jeans\"></figure><p>A pair of jeans</p><p><strong>$39.66</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://content.r9cdn.net/rimg/images/costoflivingitems/transportation/transport1.jpg?v=46989e3286f30a819bc798e25d0cb0e129abe954&amp;cluster=4&amp;width=325&amp;height=175\" alt=\"Single public transport ticket\"></figure><p>Single public transport ticket</p><p><strong>$0.38</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://content.r9cdn.net/rimg/images/costoflivingitems/cappuccino/cappuccino1.png?v=4aa17ca3f205697029542c5455fedf5ed1d207f6&amp;cluster=4&amp;width=325&amp;height=175\" alt=\"Cappuccino\"></figure><p>Cappuccino</p><p><strong>$2.16</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Where to Eat in Dhaka</strong></h2><p>Popular restaurants include Lake Terrace for steaks, Mainland China for Chinese, and bbq Bangladesh for Korean food.

You won’t find the Panta Bhat in the Restaurant all the time. But if you search for it, you can get it luckily.

Three of the nine tiger subspecies became extinct within the last century, and the remaining six are endangered, some critically, with ongoing threats to survival ranging from habitat loss to illegal poaching.

href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india\">India</a> offers the world’s best tiger-spotting opportunities. Of its 50 tiger reserves, <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/madhya-pradesh-and-chhattisgarh\">Madhya Pradesh</a> – known as India’s ‘Tiger State’ – is home to some of the country’s most accessible and best-managed reserves including <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/attractions/kanha-tiger-reserve/a/poi-sig/1294450/356357\">Kanha</a>, which is widely thought to be the setting of Rudyard Kipling’s classic <i>The Jungle Book</i>. <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/attractions/ranthambore-national-park/a/poi-sig/1147836/356447\">Ranthambhore National Park</a> in <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/rajasthan/eastern-rajasthan\">Rajasthan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttarakhand-uttaranchal/corbett-tiger-reserve\">Corbett Tiger Reserve</a> in <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttarakhand-uttaranchal\">Uttarakhand</a> also offer particularly good chances of sightings.</p><ul><li><strong>How safaris work:</strong> With the exception of <a href=\"https://www.satpura-national-park.com/\">Satpura</a> in Madhya Pradesh, which is the only reserve offering walking safaris, safaris are conducted in Maruti Suzuki Gypsies which can be booked for morning, afternoon, and sometimes night drives with a local guide. Aim for at least four drives for the best chance of spotting a tiger.</li><li><strong>What else is there to see:</strong> Other wildlife you’re most likely to spot include deer – particularly sambar, spotted and swamp deer – raptors (owls and eagles), gaur, langurs, macaques, and if you’re lucky, maybe even a sloth bear or a jungle cat.</li><li><strong>When to go:</strong> Most tiger reserves close during the July–September monsoon season. While tigers can be spotted year-round, the hot, pre-monsoon months of April and May tend to offer the best sightings (typically at waterholes).</li><li><strong>Make it happen:</strong> The remoteness of reserves makes organised tours an attractive option. <a href=\"http://www.purequest.com/destinations/india/\">PureQuest Adventures</a> offers a 13-day ‘Jungle Book Adventure’ taking in Satpura, <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/attractions/pench-tiger-reserve/a/poi-sig/1294486/356357\">Pench</a> and Kanha Tiger Reserves.

sizes=\"100vw\"></figure><p>Nepal\'s tiger numbers are on the up – and Bardia is one of the best places to see one © Utopia_88 / Getty Images</p><h2>Bardia National Park, Nepal</h2><p>Thanks to concerted conservation efforts during the last decade, Nepal’s Bengal tiger numbers have <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/tiger-population-nepal-endangered-big-cats-news/\">almost doubled</a> during that time frame, with more than 235 individuals roaming across five national parks. Chitwan might be the best known, but in the nation’s remote northwest, <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/the-terai-and-mahabharat-range/royal-bardia-national-park\">Bardia National Park</a> is considered the best place to spot one of the 80-odd tigers that call it home.</p><ul><li><strong>How safaris work:</strong> All Bardia safari lodges offer walking and 4WD safaris. While you can cover more ground in a half-day driving safari, full-day walking safaris lend to more intimate wildlife viewings. With guides carrying only a bamboo pole for protection (tiger attacks are rare, but not unheard of) it’s a bigger thrill, too.</li><li><strong>What else is there to see:</strong> Look out for Bardia’s 30-odd greater one-horned rhino, as well as otter, crocodiles, wild elephants, five species of deer, and more. At the very least you’ll meet Vikram the rhino, a victim of human-wildlife conflict living out his days in an enclosure near the park entrance.</li><li><strong>When to go:</strong> Bardia is open year-round, but as with India, it’s generally easiest to spot tigers in the hot season when tigers (and rhino) can often be seen cooling off in the Girwa River.</li><li><strong>Make it happen:</strong> Of the several dozen safari lodges in or near the village of Thakurdwara, near the park entrance, <a href=\"http://www.bardiaecolodge.com/\">Bardia Ecolodge</a> is a standout for its superb meals and fantastic local guide. For more comfort, consider the luxurious Karnali Lodge run by responsible tourism pioneer <a href=\"https://tigertops.com/lodges/karnali-lodge\">TigerTops</a>. All good lodges can arrange transport from the local bus stop, or from <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/the-terai-and-mahabharat-range/nepalganj\">Nepalganj</a>, the closest airport.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img
